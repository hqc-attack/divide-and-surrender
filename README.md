# Divide and Surrender: HQC Improved PC-Oracle Attack

This is the artifact submission package for the paper "Divide and Surrender: Exploiting Variable Division Instruction Timing in HQC Key Recovery Attacks" by Robin Leander Schr√∂der, Stefan Gast and Qian Guo. It is to appear in USENIX Security 2024.

## Container Usage

Substitute docker for podman if you're using podman.

```sh
docker build -t das .
docker run -it --rm -v "$(realpath data)":/app/data -v "$(realpath figures)":/app/figures das
```

### Producing figures

At any point you may run the following command
to produce figures from the collected data.

```sh
python visualize/plot.py
```

The figures will be stored in the `figures` directory.
The script will skip figures for which the data has not yet been collected.
Note that we ship all our collected data


## Reproducing query metrics (Figure 12)

Simulate the attack for various oracle accuracies. 
For each oracle accuracy it records each attack run's metrics in a CSV in `data/`.
We simulated 1000 attacks per oracle accuracy, but this will take a longer.
We have removed the 0.515 oracle accuracy from the script, as the vast majority of the time will be spent running these attacks.
To enable it again, edit the script.

```sh
OPTS="--num-attacks=50" ./collect_simulation_data.sh
```

### DIV-SMT attack (Section 5.2, Requires AMD Zen2)

Run the attack using the SMT oracle
This require an AMD Zen2 processor.

We performed 1000 attacks, but this will take hours.

```sh
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release -- attack --smt --num-attacks=8 --stats-file=data/smt.csv
```

To evaluate the results run:

```sh
julia --project=. attack_stats.jl
```

### Figure 9, 10, 11 (Requires AMD Zen2):

Collect oracle accuracy metrics and side-channel timings.
Will also require an AMD Zen2 processor.

We ran this on 100 keys, but this will take days.

```sh
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release -- measure --num-keys 2 --dump-accuracy data/accuracy.csv --dump-timings data/timings.csv --max-n-traces 100
```

### Division throughput data (optional)

Collects the division throughput data for the current machine for up to 32-bit numerands.
It **cannot be run from the container** (unless you give the container read/write access to /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control and /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/rdpmc).
***THIS WILL TEMPORARILY DISABLE SMT/HYPERTHREADING ON YOUR MACHINE***.

```sh
sudo ./collect_division_throughput_data.sh 
```

## Included Dependencies and Changes

### liboqs

The HQC round 4 implementation was added to the `liboqs` library found in `liboqs-rust/oqs-sys/liboqs/src/kem/hqc_r4`.
The implementation is adapted from the [round 4 submission package](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/documents/round-4/submissions/HQC-Round4.zip) (sha256: `6f5f183c445d925e705dac1fc1a55cb53b3fafa97bd6b5c57339e4bdaca337b3`).
Some utility functions were added. These changes do not modify the attacked cryptosystem itself, but e.g. allow crafting manipulated ciphertexts or eliciting public information.
The implementation was adapted to fit into liboqs. Further, a data-race on a globally used PRNG was fixed.
